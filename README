Linux-DVB-DVBT-Apps-QuartzPVR
=============================

Linux::DVB::DVBT::Apps::QuartzPVR is a package that includes a web frontend EPG for scheduling DVB-T recordings.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

INSTALL QUESTIONS

When you run 'perl Makefile.PL' a number of questions are asked to determine your setup. The answers are then 
embedded into various config files in the installation.

Questions asked are:

* SQL_ROOT_PASSWORD - MySQL root user password so I can create the pvr database

The root user password for your MySQL server. This allows the installation to create the new MySQL user
and database used for the tv guide. 

* DVBT_FREQFILE - full path to DVB-T tuning frequency file (usually under /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t)

Give the path to the frequency file. This is used by dvbt-scan to initialise the tuner. Can alternatively supply
a 2 letter country code (for example GB) to initiatate a (much longer) full frequency scan.

* MAIL_TO - email account to mail PVR errors to

Give a mail account (e.g. fred@bloggs) to which all script errors will be sent. This is useful for cases where a 
program has failed to record. 

* WEB_USER - user name of the web server

User name that your web server uses (e.g. on Ubuntu this is www-data). Script should have worked out the correct
setting, but change if it's not correct for your system.

* WEB_GROUP - group name of the web server

Group name that your web server uses (e.g. on Ubuntu this is www-data). Script should have worked out the correct
setting, but change if it's not correct for your system.

The script then asks if you want to use the default values for the "extra" options. These defaults will work on any 
system, but you may answer 'no' to allow you chance to see and change all of the following settings:



* SERVER_PORT - TCP port of the new PVR server that I will install

Specify a different TCP port number for the PVR server to use. The server provides the interface between the scheduling
Perl script and the web frontend 

* SQL_USER - username of the MySQL pvr database owner

Change the MySQL username that will be created for the tv guide database

* SQL_PASSWORD - password of the MySQL pvr database owner

Change the MySQL password that will be used for the tv guide database

* PVR_USER - Linux user name created for recording

Specify a username to use for running the recording scripts. By default a new system user will be created, but you can
also specify an existing user. Note that recordings are added to that user's crontab

* PVR_GROUP - Linux group name for PVR_USER

Specify a group to use for running the recording scripts. By default uses 'video' to allow access to the DVB-T drivers.

* PVR_LOGDIR - location of PVR logs

A directory under which all PVR logs are stored

* DATABASE - PVR database name

The MySQL database name to use for the tv guide

* VIDEO_DIR - Video recording top-level directory

The directory under which all videos are recorded

* AUDIO_DIR - Audio recording top-level directory

The directory under which all audio files are recorded

* VIDEO_TRASH - Video trashcan directory

During recording, various temporary video files are created and then removed. By default the "deleted" files are moved
to this trashcan location. A cron job is set up in the QUARTZPVR user's crontab which deletes trash files after a week.

This is done to ensure you always have access to the raw recording just in case the file left in the video directory
is not playable (allows for re-processing the original).

* VIDEO_PATH - Video file full path

Recorded video file will be stored with this full pathname. Obviously the filename must contain variables otherwise every
recording will overwrite the previous recording.

The default setting is: $video_dir/$title/$tva_series/$YmdHMS-$name.ts

The full list of variable that can be used are:


	$Y
	Four digit year (e.g. 2011) of recording start date.
	
	$m
	Two digit month with leading zero of recording start date.
	
	$d
	Two digit day with leading zero of recording start date.
	
	$H
	Two digit hour with leading zero of recording start time.
	
	$M
	Two digit minute with leading zero of recording start time.
	
	$S
	Two digit second with leading zero of recording start time.
	
	$Ymd
	Shortcut to using Y, m, d variables individually (e.g. results in 20110901 for September 1st, 2011)
	
	$HMS
	Shortcut to using H, M, S variables individually (e.g. results in 173500 for 17:35:00)
	
	$Ymd
	Shortcut to using Y, m, d, H, M, S variables individually (e.g. results in 20110901173500 for September 1st, 2011 at 17:35:00)
	
	$genre
	Broadcast genre string. This is usually not much use as it only conveys 'Film', 'Show', or 'News'.
	
	$series
	If the program is part of a series, then this variable is set to 'Series X'.
	
	$series_num
	If the program is part of a series, then this variable is set to the series number e.g. 'X'.
	
	$episode
	If the program is part of a series, then this variable is set to 'Episode Y'.
	
	$episode_num
	If the program is part of a series, then this variable is set to the episode number e.g. 'Y'.
	
	$tva_series
	Set to the TVAnytime series string (f present).
	
	$tva_prog
	Set to the TVAnytime program string (f present).
	
	$title
	Set to the program title (e.g. 'The Big Bang Theory').
	
	$subtitle
	This is the "minor title" or extra details string extracted from the program description.
	
	$name
	Set to a meaningful name for the program. Default is to the use the title.
	
	$audio_dir
	Set to the top-level path for recording all audio files. This is initialised when the application is installed.
	
	$video_dir
	Set to the top-level path for recording all video files. This is initialised when the application is installed.
	
	$dir
	Automatically set to video_dir or audio_dir depending on the file type.
	

* AUDIO_PATH - Audio file full path

Recorded audio file will be stored with this full pathname. 

The default setting is: $audio_dir/$title/$series/$YmdHMS-$name.mp3

* PVR_ROOT - Installation directory. This is where all of the PVR software is installed.

This is where the web frontend files (PHP, CSS, Javascript) are installed. You will need to add an entry to your 
web server configuration to allow access to this directory (and it is up to you to protect site access).

* ADAPTERS - DVB-T/T2 adapters to be used

Space separated list of the adapter numbers to use (leave blank for default)

* ADSKIP - Advert removal

Advert removal (1=remove adverts, 0=do not remove adverts)

* DATE_TZ - Timezone
Your timezone (as defined for the PHP Date object)

* PHP_SEARCH - Include all PHP libs

Allow use of other installed PHP (may cause name clashes). 

* PHP_LOG - PHP log file

Debug: Log file to use for PHP application. Default is no log file specified so no logging is done. 

Note: You are responsible for ensuring the directory is writable by the web server.

* SERVER_DEBUG - QuartzPVR server debugging

Debug: Level of server debug logging. Debug logs will be stored in /var/log/quartzpvr-server.log



UBUNTU

If you haven't already got DBD::mysql, then you may need to install libmysqlclient-dev package for the cpan install
to work properly (it needs mysql_config). Run:

	sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

DEPENDENCIES

To run the web frontend you need to have installed:

	web server (preferably apache)
	php
	MySql
	a dvb package (to provide the initial frequency file)

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	use App::Framework ;
	use Linux::DVB::DVBT ;
	use Linux::DVB::DVBT::TS ;
	use Linux::DVB::DVBT::Advert ;
	use MP3::Tag ;
	use DBI ;
	use DBD::mysql ;
	use Net::Server::Fork ;


OPTIONAL

If you have access to the BBC iplayer, you can schedule iplayer file downloads via the EPG. To do this you need
to install get_iplayer from http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer/html/get_iplayer.html
